Functions to read DLS data, apply the CONTIN analysis and plot the CONTIN results.

This is a wrapper around the original Fortran code of S. Provencher.
As the license is unclear please download and install if needed.

For CONTIN refer to  http://s-provencher.com/contin.shtml

**For using CONTIN and the wrapper you need a working CONTIN executable in your path.**

    Inverse Laplace transform known as CONTIN analysis developed by Steven Provencher [1,2]_ .
    
    This is a wrapper for the original FORTRAN program from Steven Provencher.
    The CONTIN analysis is developed for heterodisperse, polydisperse, and multimodal systems that cannot
    be resolved with the cumulant method. The resolution for separating two different particle 
    populations is approximately a factor of five or higher and the difference in relative 
    intensities between two different populations should be less than 1:10−5. (from Wikipedia and own experience).
    Iuser[i] and Rxx are defined in the original Fortran code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    datalist : dataList or single dataArray
        Correlation data as measured e.g. by DLS
        Check type parameter dependent on input data g1 or g2!!!!
        Each dataArray is processed.
    timescale : float; default 1e-6
        Timescale factor. CONTIN uses internal units of seconds.
        As typical instruments use microseconds the time axis needs to be scaled by this factor.
    Ngrid : int
        Number of points between min and max.
    tmin,tmax : float,int
        First/last time value to use in fit
        If tmin/tmax are negative the number of points are dropped at begin/end.
        eg min=-5 drops the 5 shortest time points; for max the 5 last points
    gmin/gmax : float
        First/last time value in distribution
        If not given calculated from tmin/tmax according to used kernel
    qgmin/qgmax : float
        Only for 'relax'.  Same as gmin,gmax except that gmin=qgmin/q^2
    qtmin/qtmax : float
        q^2*t scaled times
    bgr : float; default 0
        if >0:assume background and fit it
    typ :  int;  default 0
         |  0    input is g1 (Field correlation)
         |        -> means dont change input  in datalist
         |  1    input is intensity correlation g2 as measured by DLS;
         |        =>  field correlation is calculated as  g1= sign(g2/R21-1)*abs(g2/R21-1)^0.5
         | -1    input is g2-1 of DLS,  takes only the square root; sign preserved as for 1
         |                ALV and Malvern Zetasizer save g2-1
    distribution : string, default='x',
        | selects Iuser(10) as {'m':1,'D':2,'L':2,'r':3,'u':4,'x':4,'d':4,'T':4} according to first character of
        | distribution and RUSER(15,16,17,19). The kernel  g1=l^R23*exp(-R21*t*l^R22) describes
        | always the field correlation.

    Peak area is strongly dependent on the peak point separation P(i)*(x[i]-x[i-1]) in particular on a log scale.

def readZetasizerNano(filename, NANOcoding="cp1257", NANOlocale=None):
    """
    Read ascii file data exported from Malvern Zetasizer Nano.

    Format of Zetasizer is one measurement per line with content defined in export macro.
    First line gives names of columns as header line, so header line in NANO export is necessary.
    Lists as Sizes, Volumes... need to be separated by "sample name" because of different length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : string
        Zetasizer filename
    NANOcoding : string
        UTF coding from Windows
    NANOlocale : list of string
        | encoding of weekday names in NAno textfile
        | ['de_DE','UTF-8'] NANO set to German
        | ['en_US','UTF-8'] NANO set to US
        | ...

    Returns
    -------
    dataList
        X,Y columns are
         * correlation data [CorrelationDelayTimes,sign(CorrData)*|CorrelationData|**0.5, CorrelationData] if present
         * or RelaxationTimes, Sizes, Intensities, Volumes, Diffusions if present
        If no correlation or sizes the data are zero and only parameters are stored.
        No unit conversion is done.
        Parameters contain any other information stored in line.

    CorrelationData.Y contains 1-g2=g1**2 with 0 for negative 1-g2.

    Notes
    -----
    The template for export in Zetasizer has some requirements:

    - The header line should be included.
    - Separator is the tab.
    - First entries should be "Serial Number" "Type" "Sample Name" "Measurement Date and Time"
    - Sequence data as "Sizes", "Intensities" should be separated by "Sample Name" as separator.
    - Appending to same file is allowed if new header line is included.
