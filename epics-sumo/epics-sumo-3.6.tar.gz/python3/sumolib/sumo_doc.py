mandatory here. With --dbdir you specify the drectory where the new

""",
'db edit': r"""
db edit
:::::::

Start the editor specified by option --editor or the environment
variables "VISUAL" or "EDITOR" to edit the dependency database file.
This command first aquires a file-lock on the file, that prevents
other users from acessing the file at the same time.  When the editor
program is terminated, sumo checks if the file is still a valid JSON
<http://www.json.org> file. If not, you can start the editor again or
abort the program. If the file is valid JSON <http://www.json.org>,
sumo commits the changes if option --dbrepo was specified.  If option
--logmsg was given, this is used as commit log message, otherwise an
editor is started where you can enter a log message. Finally the file
lock is released. If you want to edit the dependency database file you
should always do it with this command.

db format

Just load and save the dependency database. This ensures that the file

'db cloneversion MODULE OLD-VERSION NEW-VERSION [SOURCESPEC]': r"""
db cloneversion MODULE OLD-VERSION NEW-VERSION [SOURCESPEC]
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This command adds a new version of a module to the dependency database
by copying the old version. MODULE here is just the name of the module
since the version follows as a separate argument.

If SOURCESPEC is not given, the command copies the source
specification from OLD-VERSION but sets the tag to NEW-VERSION. Note
that this is not allowed for "path" and "tar" sources (see below).

If SOURCESPEC is given, the source specification from OLD-VERSION is
copied an the all values from SOURCESPEC are added.

A sourcespec has the form:
  NAME=VALUE[,VALUE...] [NAME=VALUE[,VALUE..] ...]

In general, NAME must start with a letter or underscore character and
must be
following by a sequence of letters, underscrores or digits.

A VALUE must be a JSON simple value (no map or list). If VALUE is a
string, it must be enclosed in double quotes '"' if it contains any of
the characters '"', ',' or ' '.

These are possible names:

type
  The source type. Currently known are "path", "tar", "cvs", "svn",
  "darcs", "hg" and "git".

url
  This is the URL. For the types "path" and "tar" it may also be a
  filename.

tag
  This defines the revision tag.

rev
  This defines the revision hash key.

patches
  This defines names or URLs for patch files. This is the only name,
  where several values may be provided as a comma separated list.

commands
  This defines commands that are executed *after* the source code is
  checked out and *before* any patches are applied.

Note that you can define an empty value (on the bash shell) like in
this example:

  tag='""'

This means that the "tag" is removed from the source specification.

The command always asks for a confirmation of the action unless option
"-y" is used.
""",
'db releasefilename MODULE RELEASEFILENAME': r"""
db releasefilename MODULE RELEASEFILENAME
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This command defines an alternative filename for the RELEASE file of
the module. Usually the RELEASE file is generated as
"configure/RELEASE". You can specify a different filename for the
given module with this command. This may be useful for support modules
that have no regular EPICS makefile system or for some special
configurations of the EPICS base. If you set the RELEASEFILENAME to an
empty string or "configure/RELEASE", the special entry for the
filename is removed for this module in the dependency database.

db replaceversion MODULE OLD-VERSION NEW-VERSION
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This command replaces a version of a module with a new version. MODULE
here is just the name of the module since the version follows as a
separate argument. All the data of the module is copied. If sourcespec
is given, the command changes the source part according to this
parameter. A sourcespec has the form "path PATH", "tar TARFILE",
"REPOTYPE URL" or "REPOTYPE URL TAG".  REPOTYPE may be "darcs", "hg"

MODULE here is a modulespec of the form MODULE:VERSION that specifies
a single version of a module.

If TARGET is given, it must be "all", "clean", "config" or "distclean"
and specifies the make target for which a recipe is defined. LINES is
a list of space separated strings. It is recommended to enclose the
line strings in single or double quotes. If LINES is not given, all
special rules for the TARGET are removed.

If TARGET (and LINES) are not given, this defines *empty* make
recipes. This has to be done for modules that have no makefile at all.
These modules are only checked out by sumo, and possibly configured
(see also "commands").

Special variables and characters when you enclose LINES in double

This command creates a new build. Each module given in MODULES here is

Command completion
------------------

Command completion means that you can press <TAB> on any incomplete
sumo command and you get a list of possibilities how to complete that
command. By pressing <TAB> several times you can try each possible
completion.

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

Command completion works with `bash` or `zsh` (Z-Shell), you need to
have one of these installed. Your environment variable `SHELL` must be
set to the binary file of the shell, e.g. `/usr/bin/bash` or
`/usr/bin/zsh`.

In any case the package `bash-completion` must be installed.

If you use the Z-Shell, the following commands must be executed at
start up. Add them for example to the file `$HOME/.zshenv`:

  autoload -U +X compinit && compinit
  autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit

There are two ways to activate command completion, described in the
following chapters.

Activate command completion on the fly
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enter this command:
  eval `sumo help completion-line`

Activate command completion permanently
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Enter this command:
  sumo help completion-script > $HOME/_sumo

Then add the line:
  source $HOME/_sumo

to your $HOME/.bashrc or $HOME/.zshrc

Completion cache files
++++++++++++++++++++++

Sumo will create cache files in your home directory to speed up
command completion. These are the files ".dbcache.sumo" and
".buildcache.sumo". If you don't want this set the environment
variable "SUMOHELP" in a way that it contains the string "nocache"
like in:

  export SUMOHELP="nocache"

If there are other help options defined in SUMOHELP, you should
seperate them with commas ",".

The build in pager allows you to navigate in long help texts that sumo
displays when you use command "help" or option "-h". There are three
modes:

pager:off
  The pager is off, all help is printed directly to the console.

pager:on
  The pager is used only for long help texts (more than 24 lines).

pager:always
  The pager is always used, even for short help texts.

Mode "pager:on" is the default.

You define the pager mode by adding one of the three strings to the
environment variable "SUMOHELP" like in:
